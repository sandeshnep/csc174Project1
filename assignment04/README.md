## Typography

1. I picked Lato Sans serif for the H1 and H2 tags because Lato is bold yet friendly and casual. It is appropriate for the content, which is about spare-time activities. 

2. Lato sans pairs well with Roboto which I used for H3 and paragraphs, which is more pragmatic and readable. Robotos' round edges make it inviting for the reader to read it. 

## Readability

1. I added sections between the H2's for semantic validity. I also added margins for each sections to maintain separations between different subtopics. 
2. I made H1 bigger, and centered, making it user friendly. 
3. I increased white spacing to H2 and P tags, which made it easier on the eyes. 
4. I increased line spacing inside P tags for the same reason. 
5. Each section has a consistent pattern of italicized H3's to contrast it from the H2. 
6. I moved H2 to the left so that it becomes clear that the content under it belongs to it, as it appears nested.
7. I arranged the H2's alphabetically, and highlighted the first letter of H2 by making it bigger and orange in appearance. This serves to improve contrast and repetition.
